    Travelling is one of those few activities that helps you rewind yourself. You go away for a few days or weeks and come back fresh and ready to take on the challenges of life. Travelling to many people is a matter of convenience, rather than a recreation activity. They only travel when they have an issue to attend to. Travelling is also not for escapists, as many people tend to believe. I used the word escapists’ not in the literary sense of the word, but rather to mean people who run away from their problems.

    <h2 id="travel">My First Solo Road Journey</h2>
    <p>
        We went to my maternal grandparents’ place in Chandigarh during our summer vacations each year. I went there with my brother and mother. When I was in my tenth standard, my vacations commenced just after the final exams in the month of March. My brother was in the seventh grade at that time and he still had to wait till the mid of May for the vacations to start.  So, we couldn’t plan anything together anytime soon.

    After a year of hard work and rigorous study sessions, I really needed a break to rejuvenate. It was then that I took permission from my parents to travel alone to visit my grandparents and cousins in Chandigarh.

     I was excited yet nervous about this first ever solo road journey of mine. I took the window seat in a bus and enjoyed the view outside. After around 2 hours, the bus stopped at a restaurant. I stepped out of the bus to grab a cup of tea and sandwich. Sitting all by myself, exploring new things was a unique experience for me.

    As we moved further on our journey, I spoke to the lady sitting beside me. She was also travelling alone. She told me that she travels alone quite frequently for business as well as leisure trips. She shared many interesting incidents. I enjoyed talking to her and before I could realize this beautiful road journey came to an end.

    <h2 id="travel"> Road Traveling with Family</h2>
    <p>
        During my last summer vacations, we all suggested different places for road trip and finally decided to go to Bandarban.Bandarban is around five hours away from our place so we decided to go for a night journey. We booked a Five-seater cab to accommodate our family of five – Me, my mother, father, brother and sister.

My father chose not to drive as it was a night journey and he wanted to wake up fresh the next morning. The driver who accompanied us was not only skilled at driving in hilly areas but was also aware about the various site-seeing places in Dalhousie as he had been there few times.

We played antakshari and dumb charades and chatted with each other until late night. Next morning, we woke up as the driver stopped the car and announced we have reached our destination. The place was beautiful and the weather was amazing.

    <h2 id="travel">My first train traveling</h2>
    <p>
        A few weeks ago, I went to Sylhet with my whole family. We went there to spend the summer vacation and that was a journey by train. We went to Railway Station at 9 AM and arrived on the train at 10 AM. It was my first ever train journey, I never traveled by train before.

         I really enjoyed the whole journey. After leaving Dhaka city, the side view was really amazing. I love to see natural beauty. When we came near Sylhet, I was watching tea gardens. It’s a great experience for everyone. Now I want to travel by train again.
